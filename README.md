## Abstract

* The N.C. State Tree Improvement Program has been established for over 60 years with the objective of increasing family-level genetic value in phsyiological traits such as height, volume, and/or disease resistance. Given the wide geographic range of deployment, breeding and testing strategies for the purpose of making forward selections are conducted on thousands of acres across the South Eastern United States. 

* ***This study utilizes RNA-Seq expression data obtained from 8-week-old loblolly pine seedlings to compare and contrast transcript-networks identified among families which share a common geographic origin or shared phenotypic appearance.**  

### Questions of interest:

* Are any transcript-networks associated with a specific geographic orgin?

* Do families which share a common phenotype, such as high or low volume, have unique or similar trancript-networks?

* Are there transcripts which are found to be correlated with both family origin and phenotype, or are the networks unique for each analysis?

## Background of samples

* A total of 144 biological replicates were grown from a group of families subset from the lower gulf elite population (LGEP) and 80 bioloigcal replicates were grown from the east-west diallel (EW) experiment.

* LGEP
   
   - 144 Biological Replicates x 3 technical replicates = 432 technical replicates

* EW

   - 80 Biological Replicates x 3 technical replicates = 240 technical replicates

* Note that some samples from the EW had to be dropped after sequencing due to contamination and some families do not contain values for Volume..so the total number of bioloigcal replicates analyzed do not add up to 80+144.

## Location of data

* All raw data are stored in the same locations as noted in the breeding value prediction project but are provided again here for consistancy.

## Methods

### Step 1 - Data Prep

   Data prep includes everything from unpacking the original tar files recieved by the GSL up to estimating transcript abundance with Salmon. Additionally, this step includes identification of the indicies used within both batches and creates an experimental info matrix containing all meta data from both batches.
      
   See the [raw reads README](https://github.com/arfesta/Breeding-Value-Prediction/blob/master/disk6directory/rawreads/README.md) for step by step processing of files.  

### Step 2 - Load Count Data
      
   Once counts have been estimated, the next step involves reading in the aligned biological replicate counts using the tximport package.
      
   Additionally, the phenotype and other sample meta-data is constructed for normalization.

### Step3 - Conduct pairwise DE tests among families

  An initial filter was applied so that only families which had **3 or more** bioloigcal replicates were kept for further analysis.  The 57 families which passed this threshold were then used with the R package `DESeq2` to test for differential epxression among all pairs of families.
  
 The result of this step is a list of 1596 comparisons.  Each comparison contains the results from DESeq2 between family X vs. family Y.

### Step4 - Conduct DE tests among State of origin

  Similar to conducting pairwise tests among all families, the same filter was applied so that only families which had **3 or more** bioloigcal replicates were kept for further analysis. However, an additional filter was applied here to remove all families which were not open-pollinated. The 41 families which passed this threshold were then used with the R package `DESeq2` to test for differential epxression among the following states `NC, SC, GA, FL, TX`
  
 The result of this step is a list of 840 comparisons.  Each comparison contains the results from DESeq2 between family X vs. family Y.
